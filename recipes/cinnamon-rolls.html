    <h3>Description</h2>
    <p>This cinnamon roll recipe starts with an easy dough made in your bread machine, and the rolls take just 15 minutes to bake in your oven. With a sweet cinnamon, sugar, and pecan filling and a decadent cream cheese frosting, they taste just like the ones sold at that well-known store in the mall.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup warm milk</li>
            <li>¼ cup water at room temperature</li>
            <li>¼ cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 large egg, room temperature</li>
            <li>4 cups bread flour</li>
            <li>½ (3.4 ounce) package instant vanilla pudding mix</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>¾ cup chopped pecans (Optional)</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>½ cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 cup confectioners' sugar</li>
            <li>¼ cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>½ (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons milk</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the dough: Place milk, water, melted butter, egg, bread flour, pudding mix, sugar, salt, and yeast into a bread machine in the order listed, or follow the order recommended by the manufacturer if different. Run Dough cycle. Remove dough from the machine after the cycle is done, about 90 minutes.</li>
            <li>When the dough is almost finished, start the filling: Mix brown sugar, pecans, and cinnamon together in a bowl until well combined. Butter a 9x13-inch baking pan.</li>
            <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and roll into a 17x10-inch rectangle. Spread 1/2 cup softened butter over the rectangle, then sprinkle brown sugar mixture over top.</li>
            <li>Beginning with the long side, roll dough over filling into a log; cut log into sixteen 1-inch slices. Place slices, cut-sides up, into the prepared pan. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Bake rolls in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the rolls are cooling, make the frosting: Stir confectioners' sugar, softened butter, cream cheese, milk, and vanilla together in a bowl until well combined. Spread over warm rolls.</li>
        </ol>
