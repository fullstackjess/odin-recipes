    <h3>Description</h2>
    <p>The holiday hoopla is over and I'm setting my sights on eating whole. Ramen has been all the rage and I've been dying to try this at home. I never skimp on flavor even when I'm eating light. This dish is a total flavor bomb, filled with a rich broth, tender meat, and noodles, topped with a 7-minute egg – my new favorite thing in the world. My family went nuts for this; it's complex, easy, and satisfying. You don't have to make the egg, but I think it's so worth it.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 medium onion, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger</li>
            <li>½ cup rice vinegar, or to taste</li>
            <li>½ cup reduced-sodium soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons oyster sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons mirin</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon fish sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sriracha sauce</li>
            <li>4 cups low-sodium chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>1 cooked chicken breasts, shredded</li>
            <li>¾ pound baby bok choy, quartered lengthwise</li>
            <li>3 (3 ounce) packages dried ramen noodles</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>1 jalapeno pepper, sliced, or to taste</li>
            <li>2 green onions, chopped, or to taste</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped cilantro, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add onion and saute until starting to soften, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and ginger; cook about 30 seconds more. Add rice vinegar, soy sauce, oyster sauce, mirin, fish sauce, and sriracha sauce; stir to combine. Add chicken broth and water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer about 5 minutes. Add chicken and bok choy; simmer gently until bok choy is just tender, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Add ramen noodles and return to a boil. Cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until noodles are tender yet firm to the bite, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and drizzle with vegetable oil to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li>While ramen is cooking, fill a pot with enough water to cover the eggs and bring to a boil. Gently lower eggs into the boiling water and cook until yolks are barely set, about 7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Fill a large bowl with ice water. Transfer soft boiled eggs to the ice bath to stop the cooking process; let sit about 3 minutes. Drain eggs, carefully peel away shells, and slice in half.</li>
            <li>Divide ramen between 4 bowls. Add broth. Top each with jalapeno, green onions, cilantro, and soft boiled egg. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
